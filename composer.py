{lyrics}

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Analyze the mood and theme of the lyrics.
2. Choose a key signature that fits the emotional tone.
3. Determine an appropriate tempo (e.g., Andante, Allegro).
4. For each section ([Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge]):
   a. Describe the melodic contour (e.g., ascending, descending, arching).
   b. Specify pitch ranges (e.g., low, middle, high).
   c. Outline the rhythm, including note durations and any syncopation.
   d. Suggest dynamic changes (e.g., crescendo, diminuendo).
5. Indicate any repetitive melodic motifs or hooks.
6. Describe the harmony, including chord progressions if applicable.
7. Suggest instrumentation that would complement the melody.

Format your response as a structured description, clearly labeling each section of the song."""

Please apply the feedback while maintaining the core musical ideas. Ensure you:
1. Preserve the overall style and mood of the original melody.
2. Maintain the song structure (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.).
3. Adjust pitch, rhythm, or harmonic elements as suggested by the feedback.
4. If changing key or tempo, explain the rationale.
5. Address any specific points mentioned in the feedback.
6. Ensure the adjusted melody still complements the lyrics.
