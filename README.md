# 🎵 Song Writer AI 🤖

Welcome to Song Writer AI! This is a fun app that helps you create songs using artificial intelligence. It's like having a robot friend who loves music and wants to write songs with you!

## 🌟 What Does It Do?

1. You give it a theme or idea for a song.
2. It writes lyrics for you.
3. It comes up with a cool music style to go with the lyrics.
4. You can make the song even better by giving it feedback.

## 🧠 How It Works

Imagine our app is like a big music factory with different rooms:

1. **The Idea Room (main.py)**
   - This is where you first enter. You tell the app what kind of song you want.
   - It's like the boss of the factory, making sure everything runs smoothly.

2. **The Lyric Writing Room (lyricist.py)**
   - Here, a super smart robot poet writes the words for your song.
   - It knows lots of words and how to make them rhyme and sound cool.

3. **The Music Style Room (composer.py)**
   - Another robot in this room thinks about what kind of music would sound good with the words.
   - It doesn't make the music, but it describes how it should sound.

4. **The Putting-It-All-Together Room (song_writer.py)**
   - This is where the lyrics and music style come together to make a complete song idea.

5. **The Talking-to-AI Room (ollama.py)**
   - This is like a telephone that lets our app talk to a very smart AI brain to get creative ideas.

6. **The Display Room (index.html)**
   - This is where you see the finished song on your computer or phone screen.

## 🚀 How to Use It

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Type in an idea for a song (like "space pirates" or "friendly dragons").
3. Click the button to make a song.
4. Read the lyrics and music style the AI created.
5. If you want to make it better, give some feedback and click to refine the song.
6. You can copy the lyrics or music style description to use later.
